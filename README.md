## Custom Rulesets

### Custom Rulesets for PMD

https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_making_rulesets.html#referencing-a-single-rule

I wrote a custom rule `custom-pmd-ruleset.xml` and added it to the ruleset list in th PMDTest.
Inside the `custom-pmd-ruleset.xml` I referenced a custom JAVA class `PublicEnumInClassRule` which extends the `AbstractJavaRule` class.

By now, the rule is not recognized by PMD. I think I have to add the rule as a maven plugin (dependency) as a jar file.
This link will help me maybe: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43601640/classnotfoundexception-using-custom-java-rule-for-pmd-ruleset.
