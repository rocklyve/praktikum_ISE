# Static Code Analysis by David Laubenstein

## Introduction

This project represents a static code analysis tool, which is able to detect code smells and other problems in java code.
The main part of this project are the tests, which will recursivly search for all java files in a given directory and analyze them towards multiple rules.
The own rules are given by the supervisors, as they are part of the lecture "Programmieren", which is part of the first bachelor semester.
The task was to map existing rules from existing frameworks to the own rules, which are given by the supervisors.
The rules are listed in the rules section and mapped to a given rule, if a rule is existing.
The rules are based on the Sonarqube and PMD ruleset, which are sets of rules for static code analysis.
Furthermore, custom rules where written for rules, which are not existing in the rulesets, but slightly easy to implement.

## Installation + Usage
To run the tests, you need to have maven and java17 installed on your machine.
Choose your IDE and import the project as a maven project.
Afterwards, execute the tests in the IDE.

## Rules

The rules are based on the rulesets from Sonarqube and PMD. 
They both have a lot of rules, which are not needed for this project.
The exercise was to map the existing rules with the own rules from the lecture "Programmieren".

### Research

One of the first tasks was to find out which tools are available for static code analysis. 
There are a lot of tools out there which will now be compared in detail:

#### PMD

##### Usage + installation procedure + size

MAVEN: There is a maven plugin (https://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-pmd-plugin/usage.html), where you are easily able to integrate pmd into your java project.

It's easy to run PMD inside of java -> https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_tools_java_api.html

##### Feature Set + Parameters

Toolset: https://pmd.sourceforge.io/pmd-6.51.0/pmd_rules_java.html

attention: Local attribute
For final -> LocalVariableCouldBeFinal parameter (A local variable assigned only once can be declared final).

Report can be collected with performAnalysisAndCollectReport() (https://docs.pmd-code.org/apidocs/pmd-core/6.44.0/net/sourceforge/pmd/PmdAnalysis.html#performAnalysis())

##### Extendability

You can write on rules, take a look here: https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_pmd_rules.html
A host server is needed, so you have to run a self hosted server for any analyzation procedures.

#### SonarCube

##### Usage + installation procedure + size

MAVEN: Integration: https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/analysis/scan/sonarscanner-for-maven/

I only had a short period of time to take a look into it, but it seems that sonarcube has all it's analyzation tools inside the server.

(Maybe Solution: SonarLint -> https://docs.sonarqube.org/latest/images/dev-cycle.png)

#### Spotbugs

##### Usage + installation procedure + size

MAVEN: supported https://spotbugs.github.io/spotbugs-maven-plugin/

##### Feature Set + Parameters

has a lot of useful features and can be extended

##### Extendability

own detectors via jar file or repository

#### Git Maven Plugin

##### Usage + installation procedure + size

Seems to be a plugin only, where you cannot extract the information that easy.

#### UC Code Detector

##### Usage + installation procedure + size

Seems to be a plugin only, where you cannot extract the information that easy.

#### Other tools

EMMA https://emma.sourceforge.net/
EclEMMA https://www.eclemma.org/

## Custom Rulesets

### Custom Rulesets for PMD

https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_making_rulesets.html#referencing-a-single-rule

and 

https://pmd.github.io/latest/pmd_userdocs_extending_writing_rules_intro.html

Custom rules can be written in PMD and are created in the file: `custom-pmd-ruleset.xml`. 
This file is added to the ruleset list in the PMDTest.
Inside the `src/test/resources/custom-pmd-ruleset.xml` file, a rule can be created with `<rule>RULE CONTENT</rule>`.
In every rule, a description `class` exists, which references to a java class the rule will be executed or validated. 
For example, a custom JAVA class `PublicEnumInClassRule` which extends the `AbstractJavaRule` class is created and will verify, that public enums inside classes are not allowed.
All java classes of the custom rules are located in the `src/test/java/customPMDRule/` folder.

By now, the rule is not recognized by PMD. I think I have to add the rule as a maven plugin (dependency) as a jar file.
This link will help me maybe: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/43601640/classnotfoundexception-using-custom-java-rule-for-pmd-ruleset.


### Custom Rulesets for Sonarqube

https://docs.sonarqube.org/9.6/extension-guide/adding-coding-rules/

Also it's possible to create own rules with Sonarqube, but they will be not mentioned here, because PMD can cover all requirements.
